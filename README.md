# AirBnB Clone Project

This project is the first step towards building a full web application for managing AirBnB objects. It includes a command interpreter to create, manage, and manipulate objects.

## Description

The command interpreter allows users to:
- Create a new object (e.g., User, Place)
- Retrieve an object from storage
- Perform operations on objects (e.g., count, compute stats)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## How to Start

To start the command interpreter, run the following command:
```sh
./console.py
